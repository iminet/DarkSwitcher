# DarkSwitcher

This is a free application for Windows 10, what helps you to schedule switching between dark and light theme automatically.

I can't provide the source code right now, you can only download the installer only. Publishing source code is in my future plans.

## Important
This tool works on Windows 10 only. If you install this tool on other operating systems, switching between dark/light theme won't work.

## Feedback
Since this software is under development, your feedbacks are highly welcomed. Thank you! If you're getting bugs or unwanted behaviors, please report it me first, instead of negative or swearing comments.
