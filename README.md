# DarkSwitcher
This is a free application for Windows 10, what helps you to schedule switching between dark and light theme automatically.

I can't provide the source code right now, you can download the installer only. Publishing source code is in my future plans.

## Download and install
You can download the installer of the latest version by clicking on the [Releases](https://github.com/iminet/darkswitcher/releases) link. By choosing the latest version, click on the DarkSwitcherSetupx.x.xxxx.exe to download the installer. After the installer downloaded, you can run the installer like any Windows programs.

## System requirements
- a PC running Windows 10 (x86 or x64)
- [.NET Framework 4.8 or newer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)
- a few megabytes of free space on your SSD/HDD

## Important
This tool works on Windows 10 only. If you install this tool on other operating systems, switching between dark/light theme won't work.

## Command line (CLI)
Coming soon...
