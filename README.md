# DarkSwitcher
This is a free application for Windows 10, what helps you to schedule switching between dark and light theme automatically.

I can't provide the source code right now, you can only download the installer only. Publishing source code is in my future plans.

## Download
You can download the installer of the latest version by clicking on the [Releases](https://github.com/iminet/darkswitcher/releases) link

## Important
This tool works on Windows 10 only. If you install this tool on other operating systems, switching between dark/light theme won't work.

## Command line (CLI)
Coming soon...
